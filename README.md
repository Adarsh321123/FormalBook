# Formal BOOK

A work-in-project attempt to formalize [Proofs from the BOOK](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-57265-8) using [Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/).


# Structure

For each chapter in the book, there is a lean source file containing as many formalized definitions, lemmas, theorems and proofs as we can reasonably currently formalize using [Lean's mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib).

The goal is to make the formalizations of the proofs as close as possible to the proofs in the book, even if a different proof for a theorem might already be present in mathlib or more suitable for formalization.

We attempt to follow the (naming conventions)[https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html] and (code style)[https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/style.html] of mathlib.
