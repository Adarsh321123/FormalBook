\begin{theorem}[Buffon's needle problem]
  \label{buffon_needle}
  If a short needle, of length $\ell$, is dropped on paper that is ruled with
  equally spaced lines of distance $d \geq \ell$, then the probability that the
  needle comes to lie in a position where it crosses one of the lines is exactly
  \[
  p = \frac{2 \ell}{\pi d}.
  \]
