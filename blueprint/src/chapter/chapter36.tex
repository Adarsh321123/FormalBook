\begin{lemma}
  \label{ch36lemma1}
  Any $(r \times n)$-Latin rectangle, $r < n$, can be extended to an $((r+1) \times n)$-Latin
  rectangle and hence can be completed to a Latin square.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We apply Hall's theorem \ref{ch30theorem3} (see Chapter \ref{chapter30}). Let $A_j$ be the set of numbers that do
  not appear in column $j$. An admissible $(r+1)$-st row corresponds then precisely to a system of
  distinct representatives for the collection $A_1, \dots, A_n$. To prove the lemma we
  therefore have to verify Hall's condition (H). Every set $A_j$ has size $n - r$, and every
  element is in precisely $n - r$ sets $A_j$ (since it appears $r$ times in the rectangle).
  Any $m$ of the sets $A_j$ contain together $m(n - r)$ elements and therefore at least $m$
  different ones, which is just condition (H).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{ch36lemma2}
  Let $P$ be a partial Latin square of order $n$ with at most $n - 1$ cells filled and at
  most $\frac{n}{2}$ distinct elements, then $P$ can be completed to a Latin square of
  order $n$.

\begin{theorem}[Smetaniuk's theorem]
  \label{smetaniuk_theorem}
  Any partial Latin square of order $n$ with at most $n - 1$ filled cells can be completed to a
  Latin square of the same order.
