\begin{theorem}[Borsuk's conjecture]
  \label{borsuk_conjecture}
  Let $q = p^m$ be a prime power, $n := 4q - 2$, and $d := \binom{n}{2} = (2q - 1)(4q - 3)$.
  Then there is a set $S \subseteq \{+1, -1\}^d$ of $2^{n-2}$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$
  such that every partition of $S$, whose parts have smaller diameter than $S$, has at least
  \[
  \frac{2^{n-2}}{\sum_{i=0}^{q-2} \binom{n-1}{i}}
  \]
  parts. For $q = 9$ this implies that the Borsuk conjecture is false in dimension $d = 561$.
  Furthermore, $f(d) > (1.2)\sqrt{d}$ holds for all large enough $d$.
